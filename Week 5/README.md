## Introduction

> Our objective is to integrate rvmyth with DAC before proceeding onto Openlane. Here, rvmyth is the RISC-V core and DAC converts the digital output coming out of the core into an analog output. Since DAC is an analog block, it can't be written using synthesizable constructs in verilog. Hence, a functional verilog code is written to make it work and an interface is created between the core and DAC because the core is a digital block. Opensource tools like iverilog, gtkwave and yosys are used to perform this.
