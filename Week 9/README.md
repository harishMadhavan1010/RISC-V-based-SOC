# SRAM Modelling

## Current Status:

   As of now, the document stands unfinished but several relevant images are attached to showcase the current status of my progress. I intend to finish this document as soon as possible (most likely by next week). What remains is to finish interfacing the SRAM with the RISC-V core I've developed earlier as its instruction memory.
