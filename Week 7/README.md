## Openlane and Sky130 PDK

   Let's first consider a QFN-48 package (Quad Flats No-leads with 48 pins); the chip itself is towards the middle of the package which is connected to the pins by wire bonds. Pads allow the transmission of signals from inside the chip to outside of the chip and vice versa. The core of the chip basically contains all the logic required and a die is a small block of semiconducting material on which a given functional circuit is fabricated.
